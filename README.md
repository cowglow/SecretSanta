# SecretSanta

Have you ever gotten an interview question that you couldn't answer. This is what this project is all about. 
That experience was humbling for me. But it also ignited a fire inside which fuel my search for an answer.

The question was how I would sort a list of people in a [Secret Santa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) game and 
ensure that siblings (i.e. people with the same last name) wouldn't be matched with one another. So Luka Skywalker 
wouldn't give a gift to his sister Lea Skywalker. 

The original project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1. But since then, Angular has evolved and Bower has been replaced by Yarn. So I modernized it.
